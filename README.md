Introduction
Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and play a crucial role in developing efficient and optimized software. This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of commonly used data structures and algorithms using the C++ programming language.

Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the basics or an experienced developer seeking to refresh your knowledge, this repository can be a valuable resource for learning, practicing, and implementing data structures and algorithms.

Data Structures
The repository includes implementations of the following data structures:

Array
Linked List
Stack
Queue
Binary Tree
Binary Search Tree
Heap
Hash Table
Graph
Trie
Each data structure is implemented using C++ classes or structs, providing essential operations and functionalities. The implementations are well-commented and easy to understand, making it easier to grasp the underlying concepts and usage of these data structures.

Algorithms
The repository also covers a wide range of algorithms, including:

Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort)
Searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
Graph algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
Dynamic Programming algorithms
Greedy algorithms
And more!
The algorithms are implemented in separate files, each with a clear explanation of its purpose, input, and output. You can explore and study these implementations to gain a deeper understanding of the algorithms' inner workings.
